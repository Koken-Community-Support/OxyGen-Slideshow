## Changelog

### 1.0
Forked bigflannel-Slideshow-Embed and tweeked it a bit more to "our liking".
It is mostly the same plugin as before with small changes to the UX that we find making a better experience for the end user and admin.
1.) Slideshows auto play, as you would expect, since this is the default state for the built in slideshows.
2.) Click on a slideshow image opens up in lightbox view instead of advancing the slideshow.
3.) Since we opens up the lightbox on image click, we removed the title link.
4.) If no title is present for an image, we display the filename.
5.) The "next"/"previous" buttons only displays back and forward arrows instead of both arrows and text.
6.) We added .sldshw-prev, .sldshw-play & .sldshw-next to the parent <li> that holds the navigation items to make it easier to style everything to your liking.

As you can see there is not musch that is different, so wich one you choose to use is solely up to you :D
